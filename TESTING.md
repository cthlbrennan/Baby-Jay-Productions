## Compatibility 

The compatibility of all six pages of the website have been tested on different browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.

It is evident that the website has compatibility with multiple browsers.

## Responsiveness

### index.html 

As can be seen below, index.html responds well when tested on different device sizes. At mobile screen-width, there is a hamburger icon/dropdown menu which works effectively. When the screen has the width of a tablet, the hamburger icon is no longer in view, and each of the menu options become visible within the navigation bar. The responsiveness of the About and Industry sections is evident, as is that of the testimonial section. The hero image also remains centered and covers the full width of the screen at any time. 

![index.html responsiveness](documentation/testing/responsiveness/index-responsiveness.gif)

### services.html

The hero image for the services.html page also remains centered and reacts as expected. The dropdown menu and nav bar also respond as expected, as per index.html. The six boxes of the services section are lined up in a column in mobile view, then in two columns of three at tablet width, then three columns of two for laptop and desktop. We can also see in the .gif below that the various elements of the footer, including the contact details, the logo, and the social media link icons expand and retract proportionate to the width of the screen, always filling the full width of the footer in a responsive and proportionate manner.  

![services.html responsiveness](documentation/testing/responsiveness/services-responsiveness.gif)

### contact.html

This main section of this page is comprised of two main elements - the text inviting users to submit a query, and the form itself. At mobile and tablet width, these elements are stacked on one another in a column. At laptop and desktop width, they are aligned in a row, side-by-side. They respond proportionately to the width of the screen. 

![contact.html responsiveness](documentation/testing/responsiveness/contact-responsiveness.gif)


### submission.html

This is a very simple page, with one small body of text comprising a heading and a paragraph. It remains centered within the page at every screen width, performing well in its role. 

![submission.html responsiveness](documentation/testing/responsiveness/submission-responsiveness.gif)

### easteregg.html

Once again, a very simple page which can be seen below to respond well to different screen widths. 

![easteregg.html responsiveness](documentation/testing/responsiveness/easter-egg-responsiveness.gif)

### 404.html

Again, this is a very simple page which can be seen below to respond proportionately to different widths.  

![404.html responsiveness](documentation/testing/responsiveness/error-responsiveness.gif)

I am confident that the features of my website work correctly. 

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| File | Screenshot | 
| --- | --- |
| 404.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-validation/error-validation.png) |
| contact.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-validation/contact-validation.png) |
| easteregg.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-validation/easteregg-validation.png) |
| index.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-validation/index-validation.png) |
| services.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-validation/services-validation.png) |
| submission.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-validation/submission-validation.png) |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS file.

Initially, I had two errors with my CSS Validation. 

![CSS Errors](documentation/validation/css-validation/css-errors.png)

One error related to a missing comma between "Fira Mono" and "sans-serif" in a rule on line 269.

![First Error](documentation/validation/css-validation/css-errors-1.png)

This was the fix:

![First Fix](documentation/validation/css-validation/css-errors-2.png)

The second error related to the wrong use of "align-items:left" for a rule on line 724.

![Second Error](documentation/validation/css-validation/css-errors-3.png)

The fix was just to remove this line altogether, which had no effect on the styling of the relevant element in contact.html:

![Second Fix](documentation/validation/css-validation/css-errors-4.png)

As can be seen below, my CSS file was subsequently validated with no errors.

## Bugs

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

## Unfixed Bugs

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
