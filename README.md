## Introduction

Baby Jay Productions is a website designed to promote the services of a professional audio production company of the same name run by Siobhan Brosnan, a professional in the radio broadcasting and podcasting industry based in Co. Kerry, Ireland. The objective of the website is to clearly communicate the breadth and depth of Siobhan's technical and creative services to brands, companies and individuals looking to set up their own podcasts.  From reading the website, users of the website will understand and appreciate the value that Siobhan could bring to their business or creative venture, thereby providing Siobhan with new clients. The website presents information in a vibrant and professional manner that is reflective of Siobhan's approach to her work.

## UX

The primary goal was to create a vibrant, professional website that would provide prospective clients with a thorough and concise of Siobhan's skills as a technical and creative consultant in the audio and podcasting industry.

### Colour Scheme

From the outset, I understood that I wanted some bright colours to reflect Siobhan's creativity - however, it was important that the colours would appear suitably muted so as to simultaneously get her professional across to the site user, who would be likely to be a prospective client. As such, using the coolors.co website, I initially selected a palette of five colours to be used alongside black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF).

![Initial colour palette](documentation/initial-colour-palette.png)

However, after using the Colour Contrast Checker tool on audioeye.com, it was clear to me that the use of lilac (#B594B6) and thistle (#C8B8DB) would be unsuitable, as white (#FFFFFF) text upon these background colours would as background colours as white font would not meet the minimum score of 4.5 as per the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

![#B594B6 Accessibility Score](documentation/audioeye-1.png)

![#C8B8DB Accessibility Score](documentation/audioeye-2.png)

As such, I removed these two colours from my palette and added a dark pine green that would contrast positively with the rest of the palette. This was confirmed to be acceptable in terms of the WCAG 2.1 as shown below:

![#007360 Accessibility Score](documentation/audioeye-3.png)

With this change, my colour palette was finalised.  

![Finalised colour palette](documentation/finalised-colour-palette.png)

### Typography

I used the fontjoy.com website to find three free Google Fonts that I found to be complementary. 

![Selected fonts](documentation/fontjoy.png)

The three fonts selected - Fira Mono, Cousine, and Roboto Mono - are all sans-serif and so are well-suited in terms of their accessibility for screen reading. [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) was used for the logo font; [Cousine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine) was used for all sub-headings, while [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) was used for paragraphs. Both Cousine and Roboto Mono share a similar, typewriter-style aesthetic that contrasts positively with the thick bold lines of Fira Mono.  

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were also used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and above the sub-headings on the Services page.


## User Stories

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to know the purpose of the website, so that I can discern whether or not it is relevant to me.

- As a new site user, I would like the website to have good SEO scores and semantic elements so that I can easily find it through a search engine.
- As a new site user, I would like to be assured that the interactive elements of the website work, so that I can have a positive experience that wouldn't result in frustration. 


### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to know where I can find further information on the business, such as their social media presence. 
- As a returning site user, I would like to know how to contact the business directly for commercial queries.

### Frequent Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like the website to be responsive to different screen widths, so that I can easily view it on a variety of devices.


## Wireframes

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
